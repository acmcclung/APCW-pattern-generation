# INSTRUCTIONS TO GENERATE .lsp, .dxf AND .gpf FILES
1. Call writeAutoCAD.m on the appropriate .param file; in this folder there is a short script which does this operation automatically when run.
2. Open AutoCAD and start a new drawing. At the command line type `appload` and select the recently generated `.lsp` file. It will register a warning, to which you must agree. This will create a drawing file, which must be saved in `.dxf` format.
